// 1. algorithm to calculate the max and min mark

create array “marks” with 30 elements
set maxMark to 0
set minMark to 30
set counter to 0
int mark
String asstName

ask the user for the assignment name
store assignment name in asstName

repeat the following as long as the counter is <30:
	ask user for mark or if they are finished
	if user inputs "done":
		break out of the loop
	try: convert the user input mark into an integer
	catch exception: print "Error: Please enter a number"
	
	if mark < 0 or mark > 30:
		print "Error: please enter a mark between 0 and 30"

	add mark into the “marks” array at position counter
	increment counter by 1

	if mark > maxmark then
		set maxMark to mark
	if mark < minMark then
		set minMark to mark

print assignment name
print the student number and their corresponding mark
print maxMark 
print minMark

// 2. Algorithm to calculate the mean and standard deviation. In addition to the functionality in algorithm 1, do the following to compute the mean and standard deviation

int total = 0
calculate total after each iteration:
	add mark to total

calculate mean:
	if the counter is > 0:
		mean = total/counter
	else
		mean = 0

calulate variance:
	double variance = 0
	loop through the marks:
		for each mark, substract the mean and square the result
		add the result to variance

calculate sample variance:
	divide variance by counter -1

calculate standard deviation:
	get the square root of variance

print mean
print standard deviation
