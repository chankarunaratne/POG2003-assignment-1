// in addition to the content of algorithm-1, do the following for calculating the mean and standard deviation
set total = 0
update total with each iteration
double mean
calculate mean by doing the following:
	if the counter is > 0, divide the total by the counter and set it to mean
		if not, set the mean to 0
calculate the standard deviation by doing the following:
	double variance = 0
	Loop throught the marks:
		for each mark, subtract the mean and square the result
		add the answer to the variance
	divide the variance by counter-1 to find sample variance
	take the square root of variance to get the standard deviation
	
print mean
print standard deviation
