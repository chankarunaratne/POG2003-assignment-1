// in addition to the content of algorithm-1, do the following for calculating the mean and standard deviation
set total = 0
update total with each iteration
double mean
calculate mean by doing the following:
	if the counter is > 0, divide the total by the counter and set it to mean
		if not, set the mean to 0
print mean
